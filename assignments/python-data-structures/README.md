# 📘 Assignment: Data Structures in Python

## 🎯 Objective

Master Python's core data structures—lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples—by building practical programs that demonstrate when and how to use each structure effectively.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ List Operations and Manipulation

#### Description
Create a program that performs common list operations such as adding, removing, and sorting elements while maintaining data integrity.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create and initialize lists with different data types.
- Add, remove, and modify elements using appropriate list methods (append, insert, remove, pop).
- Sort and reverse lists in ascending, descending, and custom orders.
- Use list slicing to extract specific ranges of elements.
- Demonstrate list comprehension to create new lists from existing ones.


### 🛠️ Dictionary Creation and Data Lookup

#### Description
Build a program that uses dictionaries to store and retrieve structured data, simulating real-world scenarios like student records or product inventories.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create dictionaries with meaningful key-value pairs.
- Add, update, and remove key-value pairs using appropriate methods (update, pop, del).
- Retrieve values using keys and safely handle missing keys with get() or error handling.
- Iterate through dictionary keys, values, and items.
- Use nested dictionaries to organize hierarchical data.


### 🛠️ Set Operations and Uniqueness

#### Description
Implement a program that uses sets to manage unique items and perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create sets and remove duplicates from lists.
- Perform set operations: union (|), intersection (&), and difference (-).
- Add and remove elements from sets.
- Check membership and compare sets for equality.
- Use sets to find common and unique elements across multiple collections.


### 🛠️ Tuple Usage and Immutability

#### Description
Create a program that demonstrates tuples as immutable data structures for protecting data and returning multiple values from functions.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create tuples and understand their immutability constraints.
- Use tuple unpacking to assign multiple variables in a single statement.
- Return multiple values from functions as tuples.
- Use tuples as dictionary keys (when lists would not work).
- Convert between tuples and lists where appropriate.
